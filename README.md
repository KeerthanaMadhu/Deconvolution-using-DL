 # Sparse Blind Deconvolution using Deep Learning
 
The best model is in the location models/model_cnn_BN_uniform_sigma1_addnoise/
 
 
To run this code, the notebook Train_Inference.ipynb is sufficient.
Run each cell step by step to load data, train the model and run inference on test data.

While training the models, a new name has to be given to the log folder and the model folder so that models can be saved after each epoch and losses could be stored
